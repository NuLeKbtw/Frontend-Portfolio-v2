## Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website created entirely from scratch using only **HTML** and **CSS**. Unlike my previous projects, this portfolio does **not** use any frameworks like Bootstrapâ€”every element and style has been handcrafted to ensure a unique and fully customized design.

The project showcases my skills in web development and design, focusing on clean code, responsive layouts, and modern aesthetics. All components, animations, and layouts have been built manually to demonstrate my understanding of core web technologies.

In the future, I plan to enhance this portfolio by adding **JavaScript** for interactive features and dynamic content, further improving the user experience.

**Key Features:**
- 100% custom HTML and CSS (no frameworks)
- Responsive design for all devices
- Clean, semantic code structure
- Ready for future JavaScript enhancements
