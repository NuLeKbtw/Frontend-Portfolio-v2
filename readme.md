## Personal Portfolio Website
This is a fully custom personal portfolio website built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” without relying on any external frameworks or libraries. Every element, style, and feature has been handcrafted to ensure a unique design and complete control over the codebase.
The project highlights my front-end development skills, focusing on clean code, responsive layouts, and modern aesthetics. With the use of vanilla JavaScript, the site includes dynamic features and interactive components that enhance the overall user experience.

This portfolio not only showcases my technical abilities but also reflects my attention to detail and user-centered design approach. Feel free to explore the code and see how everything was built from the ground up.
